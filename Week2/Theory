In this second module we’ll look at bivariate analyses: studies with two variables. First we’ll introduce
the concept of correlation. We’ll investigate contingency tables (when it comes to categorical variables)
and scatterplots (regarding quantitative variables). We’ll also learn how to understand and compute one
of the most frequently used measures of correlation: Pearson's r. In the next part of the module we’ll 
introduce the method of OLS regression analysis. We’ll explain how you (or the computer) can find the 
regression line and how you can describe this line by means of an equation. We’ll show you that you can 
assess how well the regression line fits your data by means of the so-called r-squared. We conclude the 
module with a discussion of why you should always be very careful when interpreting the results of a 
regression analysis.
