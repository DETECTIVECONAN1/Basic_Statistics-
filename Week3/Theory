This module introduces concepts from probability theory and the rules for calculating with probabilities. 
This is not only useful for answering various kinds of applied statistical questions but also to understand 
the statistical analyses that will be introduced in subsequent modules. We start by describing randomness, 
and explain how random events surround us. Next, we provide an intuitive definition of probability through 
an example and relate this to the concepts of events, sample space and random trials. A graphical tool to 
understand these concepts is introduced here as well, the tree-diagram.Thereafter a number of concepts from 
set theory are explained and related to probability calculations. Here the relation is made to tree-diagrams
again, as well as contingency tables. We end with a lesson where conditional probabilities, independence and
Bayes rule are explained. All in all, this is quite a theoretical module on a topic that is not always easy
to grasp. That's why we have included as many intuitive examples as possible.
