Welcome to Basic Statistics. Thanks for taking this third course in the Specialization on Methods and Statistics in the Social Sciences! It’s great to have you join us!

Understanding statistics is essential to understand research in the social and behavioral sciences. In this course you will learn the basics of descriptive statistics; not just how to calculate them, but also how to evaluate them.

This course should take about 8 weeks to complete. The recommended course schedule below gives you a quick overview of the lessons and assignments to complete each week. The course load might be a bit heavier than you’re used to if you’ve taken MOOCs before. This course is part of a specialization - a series of courses - where we cover all the methods and statistics topics that are typically offered in a bachelor program in any social or behavioral field of study.

If you’re new to Coursera, we recommend you explore the course site first. Check out the navigation bar on the left. Click Course Content to see what material we’ll cover each week, and what quizzes and assignments you’ll need to complete to pass the course. See Discussions for the forums where you can discuss the material with fellow students, mentors and instructors. Please introduce yourself to everyone in the social forum!

We hope you’ll enjoy the course! Good luck, and we’ll see you in class!
