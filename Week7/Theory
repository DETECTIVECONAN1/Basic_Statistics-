Significance Tests
Matthijs Rooduijn
Emiel van Loon
In this module we’ll talk about statistical hypotheses. They form the main ingredients of the method
of significance testing. An hypothesis is nothing more than an expectation about a population. When 
we conduct a significance test, we use (just like when we construct a confidence interval) sample data
to draw inferences about population parameters. The significance test is, therefore, also a method of
inferential statistics. We’ll show that each significance test is based on two hypotheses: the null 
hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. When you do a significance test, you assume that the null 
hypothesis is true unless your data provide strong evidence against it. We’ll show you how you can conduct
a significance test about a mean and how you can conduct a test about a proportion. We’ll also demonstrate
that significance tests and confidence intervals are closely related. We conclude the module by arguing 
that you can make right and wrong decisions while doing a test. Wrong decisions are referred to as Type
I and Type II errors.
